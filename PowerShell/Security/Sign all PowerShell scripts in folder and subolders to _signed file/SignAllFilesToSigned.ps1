	 Name:          SignAllFilesToSigned
     Filename:      SignAllFilesToSigned.ps1
    ===========================================================================
    .SYNOPSIS
        Sign all scripts of the folder and create an _signed.ps1 copy there is signed. We import the complete chain.
        This is to ensure that the original file is not changed and that the signed file is created in the same folder/place as the original file.

    .DESCRIPTION
        This script is used to sign all scripts of the folder and create an _signed.ps1 copy there is signed. We import the complete certificate chain.

    .PARAMETER Path
        The path to the folder where The scripts are located.

    .PARAMETER Hash
        The hash algorithm to use for signing The scripts. The default value is SHA256.

    .PARAMETER Thumbprint
        The thumbprint of the certificate to use for signing The scripts. The certificate must be located in the current user store.

    .PARAMETER TimestampServer
        The URL of the timestamp server to use for timestamping The scripts. The default value is http://timestamp.sectigo.com.

    .PARAMETER WhatIf
        Show what would happen if The script were to run. The default value is $false.

    .EXAMPLE
        This example signs all scripts in the C:\Test directory and its subdirectories with a certificate with the specified thumbprint and hash algorithm.
        PS C:\> .\SignAllFilesToSigned.ps1 -Path "C:\Test" -Hash "SHA256" -Thumbprint "d6a630b8f65c473c19f8b694491130073fccdb32" -TimestampServer "http://timestamp.sectigo.com"

    .EXAMPLE
        This shows what would happen if The script were to run. The -WhatIf parameter is used to show what would happen if The script were to run (see command above)
        PS C:\> .\SignAllFilesToSigned.ps1 -Path "C:\Test" -Hash "SHA256" -Thumbprint "d6a630b8f65c473c19f8b694491130073fccdb32" -TimestampServer "http://timestamp.sectigo.com" -Whatif

    .NOTES
        We import the complete certificate chain and use a Timestamp Server
